# Ceed Parser

A high-performance tool for parsing and validating cryptocurrency seed phrases, mnemonics, and wallets.

## Features

- Fast validation of BIP39 seed phrases
- Support for multiple languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, etc.)
- Generation of wallet addresses from seed phrases
- Comprehensive error reporting for invalid phrases
- Fast binary search for word lookups
- Multi-threaded processing for high throughput
- SIMD-accelerated word matching and validation
- Work-stealing thread pool for optimal CPU utilization
- Custom memory pool for reduced allocation overhead
- High-performance caching for frequently accessed data

## Requirements

- C compiler with C11 support
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- OpenSSL development libraries
- SQLite3 development libraries (optional, for database support)

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For optimal performance, use:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_NATIVE=ON ..
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./seed_parser [options] <seed_phrase>
```

See `./seed_parser --help` for more options.

## Performance Optimizations

The Ceed Parser employs multiple cutting-edge optimization techniques:

1. **SIMD Acceleration**: Vectorized operations for fast word matching and validation using AVX2/SSE/NEON
2. **Custom Memory Management**: Thread-local memory pools to minimize allocation overhead
3. **Work-stealing Thread Pool**: Adaptive load balancing across CPU cores
4. **High-performance Caching**: Lock-free cache with optimized memory access patterns
5. **Branch Prediction Hints**: Strategic use of __builtin_expect for hot paths
6. **Cache Line Alignment**: Data structures aligned to avoid false sharing
7. **Link-Time Optimization**: Whole-program optimization for maximum performance
8. **CPU-specific Tuning**: Automatic detection and use of optimal instructions for the host CPU
9. **Bloom Filters**: Ultra-fast approximate membership testing for wordlists
10. **Optimized Memory Layout**: Minimizing cache misses through careful data organization
