# Test-Driven Development
- Every new feature must include updated tests.
- Run tests after every implementation change.
- Security tests are mandatory for code handling input validation, memory management, or cryptographic operations.
- Performance benchmarks should be included for critical optimizations.
- Unit, integration, and regression tests must be considered before finalizing any feature.
- TDD can be bypassed if explicitly requested, but this should be the exception, not the rule.
